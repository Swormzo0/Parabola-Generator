<img src="/parabola_antialiased.png" alt="Antialiased Parabola" width="625"/>

## Prerequisites
This program runs on the Python 3 terminal. You'll need `pypng` for this to work.

To install `pypng`, put the following piece of code in the terminal and run with administrative privileges:
~~~~ 
pip3 install pypng 
~~~~

## Which One Should I Use?
If in doubt, choose `parabolaGen_antiAliased.py`. The other `.py` files are early versions of this program.
